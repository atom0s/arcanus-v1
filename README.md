Warning
=======

_Please understand; this code is super old and from when Node.js first kicked off. It is important that you do not use this code as-is and ensure that you upgrade all libs/deps used to ensure proper security! Lots of old vulnerabilities have surfaced within dependencies that this project used throughout the years, this is not for production use as-is any longer!_
